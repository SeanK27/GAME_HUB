Game Hub - Developed by: Sean K, Liam Y, Ehtan D and Raymond W

GAMEHUB is a free unblocked online game that you can play in class and compete with others with a built in online leaderboard. We have 4 games that you can play. Those 6 games consist of ping, pastry actuator, skaavok, and worm. Three of the four games contribute to our in-game currency, HubCoin. HubCoin can be used to buy skins and a shiny new badge for your spot on the leaderboard. Compete with your friends and see who can get the most HubCoin. Best of luck and don't get caught by your teacher.
